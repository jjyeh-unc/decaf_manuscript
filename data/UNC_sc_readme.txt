# UNC-sc data can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kVuvYD8R_1eipPgdRcyEqQqo-EZM4lJ2?usp=sharing

# scRNAseq data were too large to be deposited on github, therefore were uploaded to Google Drive for reviewers.

# Cell Ranger output, as well as an Seurat object with annotated cell labels were available in the Google Drive folder.

# Raw fastq files are available to reviewers upon request.

# Raw and processed data will be deposited to GEO and made public when the manuscript is accepted for publication.
